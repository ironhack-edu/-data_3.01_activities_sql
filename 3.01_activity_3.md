In this case, we will use the same `bank` database that we used in class.

1. The `select` statement is used as a print command in SQL. Use the `select` statement to print "Hello World".
2. Use the select statement to perform a simple mathematical calculation to add two numbers. 
3. Use an appropriate `select` statement to retrieve a list of unique card types from the `bank` database, table `card`. (**Hint**: You can use the DISTINCT function here.)
4. Get a list of all the district names in the bank database. A suggestion is to use the `files_for_activities/case_study_extended` here to work out which column is required here because we are looking for the names of places, not just the IDs. You should have 77 rows.
5. Bonus: Revise your query to also show the Region, and limit the results to just 30 rows.
